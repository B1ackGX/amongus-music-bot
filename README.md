cd amongus-music-bot
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token

### 4. Create a `cookies.json` file
- Place it in the project root or in `src/config/cookies.json`.

- **Do NOT commit this file.**

#### How to get YouTube cookies
1. Install the [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) extension for your browser.
2. Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
3. Log in to your account. (**Tip:** Use a new/throwaway account for security.)
4. Click on the EditThisCookie extension icon and click the "Export" icon.
5. Your cookies will be copied to your clipboard. Paste them into your `cookies.json` file as described above.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings about YouTube cookies:**
- **Do not log out** using the logout button on YouTube/Google account manager, as it will expire your cookies. To log out, delete your browser's cookies or use incognito mode to get your cookies and then close the window.
- **Paste all cookies** from the clipboard into your `cookies.json` file. Do not remove or edit any cookies unless you know what you're doing.
- **Use the same IP**: Make sure the account you used to get your cookies is only used from one IP at a time. This will help keep your cookies valid longer.

### 5. Start the bot
```sh
npm start
```

## Usage
- Use `/play <song>` or your custom prefix (default: `.play <song>`) to play music.
- Use `/help` or `.help` for a list of commands.
- All moderation and music commands support both slash and prefix styles.

## Contributing
- Follow the project coding standards.
- Do not commit `.env`, `cookies.json`, or any sensitive files.
- Open issues or pull requests for improvements.

## Database Support

By default, Among Us! uses MariaDB. To use another database, implement the required interface in `src/services/prefixDatabase.*.js` and `src/services/emojiDatabase.*.js`, and update your `.env` with the correct `DB_TYPE`.

- MariaDB: Supported out of the box
